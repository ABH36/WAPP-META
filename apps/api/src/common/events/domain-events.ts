/**
 * Domain event catalog — the publish side of a publish/subscribe boundary
 * between business modules and cross-cutting concerns (Global Audit,
 * Notifications) that don't exist yet (SDP-001 module order — Audit and
 * Notification are later modules). Publishing now, with no listener but the
 * temporary logger (see domain-event-logger.listener.ts), means those
 * future modules subscribe without any change to the code that emits these
 * events — the publisher never needs to know who's listening.
 *
 * Event names are dot-namespaced ("workspace.created") so a future listener
 * can subscribe to a wildcard ("workspace.*", "team.*") instead of every
 * event individually (EventEmitterModule is configured with
 * `wildcard: true` for exactly this).
